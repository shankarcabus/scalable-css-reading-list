## CSS Styleguides

These styleguides articulate conventions and guidelines for authoring scalable CSS.

(I'm distinguishing *styleguides* from what I would call *pattern libraries*, which are references created to document and exemplify existing styles rather than guidelines for the authoring of the styles. Other people often use the term *styleguide* to refer to both or either of these reference types. I think pattern libraries are less specifically about scalable CSS, and more about a scalable frontend design and development workflow; so I'm not including resources related to pattern libraries.)
